UBON RATCHATHANI — Foreign military attaches made a second visit to Thailand's northeastern border on Thursday to receive briefings from Thai military officials on recent clashes with Cambodian forces. The briefing, held at a Royal Thai Army base near the Poipet crossing, covered the December 27 ceasefire agreement and measures to prevent further escalation.  

Colonel Somchai Prasertsri, who led the session, detailed troop positions, temporary fortifications, and humanitarian access corridors. He emphasized the need for continued monitoring and support from international observers to ensure compliance on both sides.  

Observers toured forward operating posts where trenches and barbed-wire barriers remain erected. The attaches were shown de-mining operations in disputed sectors and met with local officers to discuss civilian safety protocols.  

“Transparency is key,” Col. Somchai told reporters. “These attaches will carry first-hand accounts back to their home capitals, reinforcing our call for lasting peace.”  

Representatives from over a dozen countries, including the United States, France, and Japan, attended the briefing. They praised the Thai army’s openness but urged expedited humanitarian aid deliveries to displaced border communities.  

The attaches are scheduled to visit Phnom Penh next week for a reciprocal briefing by Cambodian officials.

Phnom Penh — Cambodia has voiced concerns that Thai provisional fences and land seizures along the border risk de facto annexation, officials said Wednesday. Cambodian foreign ministry spokesman Kong Sophorn told reporters that recent Thai military fortifications—barbed-wire barricades and shipping-container outposts—were constructed without bilateral agreement.  

“Such unilateral actions create new facts on the ground,” Kong said. “They threaten our sovereignty and jeopardize efforts to uphold the December 27 ceasefire.”  

Satellite imagery reviewed by Nikkei Asia shows at least five new Thai positions within territory claimed by Cambodia. Villagers report restricted access to farmland and water sources near the 250-kilometer Demilitarized Zone, originally established under a 2008 land-swap treaty.  

The Thai defence ministry countered that its measures are defensive and intended to deter cross-border infiltrations by insurgent groups. A spokesperson said the temporary barriers will be removed once trust-building measures resume.  

Human rights groups have called for international observers to document any human rights violations resulting from restricted movement. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned last week that up to 15,000 residents could be affected if restrictions persist through the planting season.  

Cambodia plans to raise the matter at a foreign ministers’ meeting in Bangkok next month, hoping to secure renewed commitments to the truce.

PHNOM PENH: A rights group has accused Thai forces of razing homes in contested border villages after clashes resumed following a brief ceasefire. The Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR) released photographs showing bulldozers demolishing wooden and bamboo houses in the Banteay Ampil district, which lies within the disputed Preah Vihear province.  

CCHR director Pung Chhiv Kek called the demolitions “a clear attempt to change the demographic makeup of the border area.” She said no warning was given to residents, many of whom fled with only the clothes on their backs.  

In a statement, the Thai army said it was removing structures it deemed “unauthorized settlements” within areas under its temporary control. It denied any intention to displace civilians permanently.  

Witnesses described hearing heavy machinery at dawn on January 19, hours after skirmishes erupted when both sides accused each other of firing mortar rounds. One villager, Sok Dara, said he lost his home and all his belongings.  

The rights group urged ASEAN and the UN to investigate the incidents and to pressure both governments to respect civilian rights. It also called for immediate compensation and relocation assistance for the displaced families.  

Local aid agencies have reported difficulties delivering food and medical supplies due to damaged roads and ongoing security concerns.
