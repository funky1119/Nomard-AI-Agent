I’d be happy to score these roles and pinpoint the best fit for you. To provide precise match scores and tailored recommendations, please share:

- Your most recent resume (or at least your key technical stack and years of experience)  
- Your preferred industries or companies  
- Any remote/flexibility requirements or contract vs. full-time preference  
- Your target salary range  

Once I have that information, I can rank each position (Google, Stripe, Square, Yelp) with match scores and detailed reasoning.
