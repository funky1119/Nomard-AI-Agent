I’m excited to dive in—before crafting a fully tailored interview prep doc, could you please share:

1. Your most recent resume or at least:
   - Key technical stack (languages, frameworks, tools)
   - Years of professional experience
2. Any industry or company preferences (e.g., fintech, big tech, startups)
3. Remote/flexibility requirements or contract vs. full-time preference
4. Your target salary range

With those details, I’ll select the single best-fit role (Google, Stripe, Square, or Yelp), compute match scores, and build you a comprehensive Markdown-formatted “Interview Prep” document. Looking forward to your info!
