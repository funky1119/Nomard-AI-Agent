To provide accurate match scores and recommendations, could you please share:

- Your most recent resume (or at least your key technical stack and years of experience)  
- Your preferred industries or companies  
- Any remote/flexibility requirements or contract vs. full-time preference  
- Your target salary range  

With that information in hand, I can score each of these four roles (Google, Stripe, Square, Yelp) against your background and explain exactly why one stands out as the best fit.
